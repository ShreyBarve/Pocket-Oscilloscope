Pocket Oscilloscope
A compact, low-cost, and portable oscilloscope designed for basic signal visualization and analysis. Built using a microcontroller and interfaced with a PC or mobile app for real-time waveform display.

üîß Features
Signal visualization up to [insert frequency range, e.g., 10kHz]
Real-time waveform display via serial communication
Adjustable time base and voltage scaling
USB-powered, pocket-sized design
Cross-platform visualization software (Python/Processing/Arduino Serial Plotter)
üß∞ Tech Stack / Tools
Microcontroller: [e.g., Arduino Nano / STM32 / ESP32]
Analog Front-End: Signal conditioning with Op-Amps and voltage dividers
ADC Sampling: Inbuilt MCU ADC or external ADC
Communication Interface: USB / UART Serial
Software Tools: Arduino IDE, Python (for GUI), Serial Plotting libraries
üñ•Ô∏è How It Works
Analog signal is fed to the microcontroller via a conditioning circuit.
Microcontroller samples the signal using its ADC.
Data is sent to a PC or mobile device via serial communication.
A GUI or serial plotter visualizes the waveform in real-time.
üöÄ Getting Started
